## 🧬 Analytics Workflow
Each assignment follows a standardized software engineering approach:
1. **Data Acquisition:** Loading structured/unstructured datasets.
2. **Data Wrangling:** Type conversion, normalization, and feature scaling.
3. **Exploratory Analysis:** Descriptive statistics and univariate/bivariate analysis.
4. **Visualization:** Generating high-resolution, publication-quality plots.
5. **Insight Derivation:** Documenting business or technical conclusions from the data.
